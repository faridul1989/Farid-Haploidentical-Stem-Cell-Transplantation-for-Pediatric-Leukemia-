% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background:} Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option for high-risk pediatric acute leukemia (AL). Conventional myeloablative regimens cause severe long-term complications, while reduced-toxicity approaches often increase relapse risk.

\textbf{Objective:} We propose a novel protocol using parent-derived, G-CSF-mobilized haploidentical peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), purified by CD34+ selection and $\alpha\beta$-T-cell depletion, with minimal conditioning to achieve stable engraftment and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects while minimizing transplant-related mortality (TRM).

\textbf{Methods:} Parental donors received G-CSF, with PBSCs harvested at peak CD34+ levels. Products were CD34+ enriched and $\alpha\beta$-T-cell depleted. Pediatric recipients underwent immunosuppression-focused conditioning (treosulfan $\pm$ fludarabine) without myeloablation. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) was used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis.

\textbf{Results:} Three infants (8--14 months) with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated compassionately. Median neutrophil engraftment was 11 days, with 100\% donor chimerism by day +21. GVHD was mild (grades 0--II).

\textbf{Conclusion:} This haploidentical protocol shows feasibility, rapid engraftment, and low GVHD in high-risk infants. It supports a hypothesis of ordered, non-stochastic stem cell homing, reducing reliance on cytotoxic ablation. Further validation via single-cell genomics and biophysical modeling is needed, potentially linking transplantation to thermodynamic principles of biological order.

% Section 1: Introduction
\section{Introduction: Ethical Need for Low-Toxicity HSCT}

Allogeneic HSCT cures high-risk pediatric leukemia but often at the cost of lifelong morbidity from myeloablative conditioning, including endocrine dysfunction, neurocognitive decline, infertility, and secondary malignancies. The ethical challenge is to preserve curative potential while minimizing harm. Haploidentical transplantation with parental donors, enhanced by $\alpha\beta$-T-cell depletion and PTCy, has reduced GVHD risks. The next step is minimizing pre-transplant toxicity by leveraging stem cell biology.

% Section 2: Hypothesis
\section{Hypothesis: Engraftment as an Ordered Process}

Traditional HSCT assumes engraftment requires marrow space created by myeloablation and host hematopoiesis destruction. We propose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stem cell homing and niche integration are deterministic, ordered processes.
    \item Immunosuppression alone enables CD34+ cell engraftment without extensive ablation.
    \item Cytotoxicity can be minimized, shifting HSCT from destruction to facilitation.
\end{itemize}
This aligns with the thermodynamic autorunner principle ($\tau$), where biological systems optimize minimal entropy and maximal recognition efficiency, reflecting cosmological order in the Tanfarid Quantum Thermodynamic Universe (TQTU) framework \citep{Chowdhury2025a, Chowdhury2025b}.

% Section 3: Clinical Protocol
\section{Clinical Protocol}

% Subsection 3.1
\subsection{Donor Mobilization and Collection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Donor:} Haploidentical parent.
    \item \textbf{Mobilization:} G-CSF 10 $\mu$g/kg/day, days -5 to -1.
    \item \textbf{Collection:} Apheresis at CD34+ peak ($\geq$8 $\times$ 10$^6$ cells/kg recipient weight).
    \item \textbf{Processing:} CD34+ enrichment and $\alpha\beta$-T-cell depletion (CliniMACS).
\end{itemize}

% Subsection 3.2
\subsection{Minimal Conditioning}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Treosulfan: 30 g/m$^2$ (days -3 to -2).
    \item Fludarabine: 150 mg/m$^2$ (days -5 to -3, optional).
    \item No total body irradiation or additional alkylators.
    \item \textbf{Goal:} Immunosuppression without organ toxicity.
\end{itemize}

% Subsection 3.3
\subsection{Infusion and Post-Transplant Care}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Day 0:} Stem cell infusion.
    \item \textbf{GVHD Prophylaxis:} PTCy 50 mg/kg (days +3, +4).
    \item \textbf{Supportive Care:} G-CSF from day +5; antimicrobial prophylaxis.
\end{itemize}

% Section 4: Pilot Data
\section{Pilot Data: Compassionate-Use Cohort}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Pilot Study Results}
\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
\toprule
Patient & Age (months) & Diagnosis & Conditioning & Neutrophil Engraftment (days) & D+21 Donor Chimerism \\
\midrule
1 & 14 & Relapsed AML & Treosulfan + Fludarabine & 10 & 100\% \\
2 & 8 & Relapsed AML & Treosulfan only & 12 & 100\% \\
3 & 11 & Relapsed AML & Treosulfan + Fludarabine & 11 & 100\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Median Neutrophil Recovery:} 11 days.
    \item \textbf{Chimerism:} 100\% donor by day +21.
    \item \textbf{GVHD:} Grades 0--II, no severe cases.
\end{itemize}

% Section 5: Discussion
\section{Discussion: Redefining Engraftment}

These results suggest high-intensity cytotoxicity is not essential for engraftment. Ordered biophysical mechanisms likely drive success:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chemokine gradients (CXCL12-CXCR4).
    \item Adhesion interactions (VLA-4/VCAM-1).
    \item Niche-specific recognition signals.
\end{itemize}
This challenges stochastic clearance models, aligning with thermodynamic integration ($\tau$ principle, TQTU) \citep{Chowdhury2025a}. The approach preserves GVL effects while reducing toxicity, enhancing ethical standards.

% Section 6: Future Directions
\section{Future Directions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Molecular Analysis:} Single-cell RNA sequencing to map host-donor interactions.
    \item \textbf{Modeling:} Bioinformatics to simulate homing vs. stochastic clearance.
    \item \textbf{Predictive Index:} Develop an Engraftment Prediction Index using CD34+ dose, purity, and recognition biomarkers.
    \item \textbf{Ethical Advances:} Explore non-chemotherapeutic immunosuppression (e.g., biologics).
\end{itemize}

% Section 7: Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}

This pilot validates a haploidentical PBSC protocol for pediatric AML, emphasizing ordered stem cell homing over ablation. Integrating clinical and thermodynamic perspectives, it suggests engraftment follows universal principles of order, with potential to transform transplantation and biological sciences.
